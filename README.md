# VF_EasyAjax Module

Allows frontend developers send ajax requests for every page and get Json response.

CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT

In the Json response frontend developers can receive:
* All messages that were added to session
* Some block from current page layout
* Any block that should be added to special layout xml

An extension works fast, without load all layout. It loads only needed data.
